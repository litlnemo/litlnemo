### Hey! 👋

I'm Wendi, an artsy nerd, or Renaissance person, or general geek who likes colorful things and music... you get the idea.

I taught web design with HTML/CSS for 15 years and have done a little coding in python, javascript, and php over the years, but promptly forgot most of that in the last few years while doing other things like recording my debut album, [Looking For Buildings](https://wendidunlap.com/music/looking-for-buildings/). (Hear it on Spotify, Apple Music, Bandcamp, all the usual places.)

### Random weird facts about me:

- 🛼 I used to be a roller figure skater
- 📖 I wrote a book about Yorkshire surnames
- 🦍 I once ran the bases before a Seattle Mariners game wearing a gorilla costume and waving a Wiffle bat

### Other stuff:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ... writing another album
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Python. RE-learning it, that is. And getting further than last time, I hope!
- 💬 Ask me about ... Medieval English surnames, haha!
- 😄 Pronouns: ... she/her/they
